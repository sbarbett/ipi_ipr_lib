IP Intelligence Python Library
=====================

This is a very basic, but extensible, Python implementation for interfacing with the Neustar IP Intelligence API.

Getting Started
===========

Edit the sample_config.ini file and add your API key/shared secret, save the file as 'config.ini'. An example query is demonstrated in sample.py. Query IP Reputation data by setting the 2nd arg in 'get' to True.
